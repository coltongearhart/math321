\begin{enumerate}
    \item A computer runs a part of a bigger machine. If the computer or the part fails, then the machine does not work. Possible outcomes, where each is an ordered pair (such as $(C_f, P_f)$) involve the following:\\% original section 1.1 notes example (changed context)
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l l}
        $C_f$: Computer fails & $C_w$: Computer works as expected\\
        $P_f$: Part fails & $P_w$: Part works as expected\\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \item[] Write the outcomes in each of the following events:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Sample space $S = $ \\
        \item Part fails $A = $\\
        \item Machine fails $F = $ \\
        \item $\comp{F} = $
    \end{enumerate}\vspace{20pt}
    
    \item An experiment consist of tossing a coin and then rolling a 6-sided die. An outcome is an ordered pair, such as $(H, 3)$. Let $A$ be event that the coin shows heads and $B$ be the event the number on the die is greater than four. List the outcomes in each of the following:\bigskip% Actex 2-10
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Sample space $S = $\vspace{40pt}
        \item $B = $\vspace{40pt}
        \item $A \cap B = $\vspace{40pt}
        \item $\comp (A \cap B) = $\vspace{40pt}
        \item $\comp (A \cup B) = $\vspace{40pt}
    \end{enumerate}\bigskip
    
    \item In an experiment of tossing two 4-sided dice, we have the following events:
    \begin{itemize}% Actex 2-11 with extra part
        \item $E = $ sum of dice is 4
        \item $F = $ both dice show the same number
        \item $G = $ both die show a number $\ge 3$ 
    \end{itemize}
    \item[] List the outcomes in each of the following events:\bigskip
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $E \cap F = $\vspace{60pt}
        \item $E \cup F = $\vspace{60pt}
        \item $E \cup (F \cap G) = $\vspace{60pt}
        \item $E \cap (F \cup G) = $\vspace{60pt}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
